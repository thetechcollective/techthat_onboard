**The Tech Collective’s DevTestOps hub offers a dedicated full-stack team of software developers. We call the team .tech that. We work by Lean Software Development principles; Continuous Delivery always supported by a fully automated declarative pipeline and containerized infrastructure and environments as code. Quality is built in; Jidoka.**

## The Tech Collective — DevTestOps

The Tech Collective (.ttc) is an independent consulting bureau initiated, owned and powered by Implement Consulting Group (IM_). .ttc gathers the best tech competences in the field and we share the same dedicated focus as IM_ on implementing and optimizing all aspects of Digital Transformations. Only; we do the tech.

The Tech Collective has pillars in various competence hubs. One of them is referred to as the _DevTestOps_ hub, We excel in forming and optimizing the Software Development Life Cycle for large or complex systems in large and distributed teams. 

Our belief is that **software should be invisible** — to the end users. All they should ever see is a delicious end-product that supports them and makes them feel good. Our dedication is to ensure high quality in software products and deliveries through building quality-in by automated verification pipelines and containerized infrastructure as code. In our nerdy world of tech this is sometimes referred to as _shift-left_ which is the philosophy of integrating Quality Assurance (QA) and testing activities earlier — in the development team — as opposed to the traditional QA approach where testing happens towards the end of development, The benefit is simply _Continuous Delivery_; a continuously improved one-piece-flow with no excess lead time.

Our initial focus in DevTestOPs was to support other teams; They could focus on the business logic and specific domain knowledge and we could make the teams go faster. When non-techies asked us _“what do you do for a living”_ we would reply:


>“We make software, 
>that software developers use, 
>when they make software”

This focus remains a big and important part of what we do. But our approach was so popular with our clients and collaboration partners that we started getting demands if we could just build the software — period.

## .tech that — our full-stack team

To accommodate this demand _”just build the software — period”_ and honestly also because we’re just crazy about building software — period. We have formed a strong full-stack team internally we call it  **.tech that** — our credo do is:

>“...we can make it go away 
>— with code” 

in **.tech that** we develop front-end, back-end and complex business logic, we design UX and CX, we automate all our tests and verifications, we define infrastructure, deploys and workflows declaratively, we believe in anything-as-code. We build quality in. We fight technical debt in the code base and muda, mura and muri[^waste] in our value stream.

[^waste]: Muda, mura and muri are lean terms, they translate to _wastefulness_, _unevenness_ and _overburdenness_. 

We do not use neither SAFe nor Scrum, but we do use both kanban, paired- and mob programming and we adhere to the principles of DevX, kaizen and lean software development. We are a distributed team that rely on social coding and asynchronous communication. Our assignments can be anywhere but still the team meets regularly in Copenhagen or Aarhus. 

We defy both phases and estimates, rather we believe in the scientific method, experiments, hypothesis testing, validated learning and plan-do-check-act cycles.

>“...Our primary measure of progress is happy end-users”

We measure their mood, we test in production, we're data-driven.
