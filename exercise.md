**I have pointed you to this instruction because you have showed insterest in possibly joining The Tech Collective's .tect that full stack team.**

This is an instruction for a small exerecise we would like you to do, it will probably take you 30 mins to complete. 
You can't winn or loose, there is no right or wrong. You can't be excluded or otherwise be ruled out. The purpose of the exercise is merely 
for for us to have something to talk about.

If - by the end of this exercise - you still would like to setup a chat then in the final step you will be offered a link where you'll can book us 
for a video meeting and we can go over your replies.

## How to start this exercise


>[!NOTE]
> 👉 Create your own copy of this repo 👈
>
>Use this repo as a <code>template</code> 
>
>In the upper right corner find the button [_Use this template`_ and then _Create new repository_](/../../generate "Note that all links in GitHub issues, discussions and .md files opens default in the same tab as your current - so make it a habit to hold down CTRL (Windows & Linux) or ⌘ (Mac) when you click a link")


#### 👉 Work those issues 👈

When the job is finished at the issues are copied over, you are good to go.

Continue there - in your own repo. Go to the ["issues"](../../issues) tab in your own copy and simply work the issues in sequence starting with `#1`.

#### 👉 One (or more) commits per issues 👈
Please work the issues in such a way, that you deliver at least one - or potentially more - commits per issue, be sure to mention the isssue in the commit message. 

>[!CAUTION]
>Restrain youself from comitting stuff,
>that spans more than one issue.
>
>  👍 More than one commit per issue
>  👎 More than one issue per commit

#### 👉 Note to self 👈

Make it a habit do write plenty of notes in the comments of each issue. Utilize your MarkDown skills and write beautyful documentation. Think of it as _a note to self;_ Imagine you come back and read this repo 6 months out in the futue, you want to be able to to follow you own lead and chain of though to the solutions. And so does your (imaginary) team mates.

#### 👉 If you need help 👈
The [discussions](https://github.com/thetechcollective/py-devx-intro/discussions "Note that all links in GitHub issues, discussions and .md files opens default in the same tab as your current - so make it a habit to hold down CTRL (Windows & Linux) or ⌘ (Mac) when you click a link") are enabled on the template repo (your source). If you need help, if you want to suggets improvements or if you have an urge to contribute to this tutorial - simply make a statement in the discussions.
